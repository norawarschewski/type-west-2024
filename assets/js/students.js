This original typeface seeks curves and forms from the carved structures found in the caves, to form tapering, narrow, and structured shapes. The serifs are heavy, and counters are constructed as though carved out of the outer forms. This typeface aims to reflect the delicate strength, and hand-carved craftsmanship of the caves, and has been built with sturdy, solid forms lending a gritty texture.",
